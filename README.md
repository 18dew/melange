Blend of Internet policy to Internet protocols

#Goals of project - 
To Facilitate a fluid mixture between governance of IP addresses with actual Internet protocols like BGP  using ethereum blockchains and smart contracts.  
To bring in new dimension for Internet governance by facilitating a IP registry and linking it with BGP protocols using Ethereum Smart contracts.

#Stakeholders 
Internet registries like APNIC, ARIN etc. - For Maintaining the ownership of IP addresses.
IETF - For upgrading the protocol definition. 
ISP’s - For Utilising the Internet or gaining the access to the internet. 
Technology companies - For getting the infrastructure by virtue of products.
Government Agencies - For defining the internet policy and course of action.


#Problem Addressed
 - Currently BGP routes of the routers amongst ISP’s is based on Peer trust model.(One to One trust Model) 
 - Where in there is implied condition / understanding with ISP’s that the router which is propagating the BGP route is trusted. 
 - There is lack of association for actual ownership of IP addresses to the BGP Protocol which leads to BGP attacks (IP / BGP Hijacking) . 
 - The BGP Hijack attack can be used to redirect traffic of internet and cause breach of security.

#Recent BGP Attacks 
 - Large Scale BGP Hijack in India

#What Melange Proposes
- A registry of IP range ownership purchased from various Internet registries. (A Smart Contract based IP address registry to denote the ownership of IP address for AS numbers. Where in only verified purchasers of IP addresses can propagate IP address to the Internet backbone.)

- Proof of ownership for IP addresses. (Associate proof of ownership to the IP Addresses and verification process for initial handshakes.)

#Components of Melange 
Blockchain - Ethereum 
Smart Contract
 - IP Registry Contract 
 - IP Auction Contract - (Need to detail a bit on issue of concurrency smart contract)
Off Chain Methods
 - Signing Token using Private keys. 
 - Verification of Signed token.
